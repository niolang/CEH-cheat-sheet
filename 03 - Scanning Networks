# Scanning Networks
TCP communication flag
Synchronize or “SYN”: It notifies the transmission of a new sequence number. This flag generally represents the establishment of a connection (three-way handshake) between two hosts.
Acknowledgement or “ACK”: It confirms the receipt of the transmission and identifies the next expected sequence number. When the system successfully receives a packet, it sets the value of its flag to “1,” thus implying that the receiver should pay attention to it.
Push or “PSH”: When it is set to “1,” it indicates that the sender has raised the push operation to the receiver; this implies that the remote system should inform the receiving application about the buffered data coming from the sender. The system raises the PSH flag at the start and end of data transfer and sets it on the last segment of a file to prevent buffer deadlocks.
Urgent or “URG”: It instructs the system to process the data contained in packets as soon as possible. When the system sets the flag to “1,” priority is given to processing the urgent data first and all the other data processing is stopped.
Finish or “FIN”: It is set to “1” to announce that no more transmissions will be sent to the remote system and the connection established by the SYN flag is terminated.
Reset or “RST”: When there is an error in the current connection, this flag is set to “1” and the connection is aborted in response to the error. Attackers use this flag to scan hosts and identify open ports.
